# “Would You Rather?” Project

This is the second project  assessment project for Udacity's React-Redux course, which is a part of the React Nanodegree program

This is a web app that lets a user play the “Would You Rather?” game.

In this app, users are able to ask and answer questions, see which questions they have/haven’t answered, see how other people have voted, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.

Once the user logs in, the user is able to toggle between his/her answered and unanswered polls on the home page. The polls in both categories are arranged from the most recently created to the least recently created
